Snake Game
A small desktop Snake game built with Python's built-in turtle module.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell)
Open PowerShell and change to the project folder:

cd "C:\Users\Rohit\PycharmProjects\Snake_Game"
(Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate
Run the game:

python main.py
Controls
Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake.

Notes
This is a desktop GUI app (uses turtle), so run it on your computer — it will not run on GitHub Pages.
No external packages are required.
